# PCLBeacon
Xamarin.Forms PCL solution for background and foreground monitoring of Beacons (a tweaked version of Chris Riesgo's Xamarin.Forms Shared solution sample, https://github.com/chrisriesgo/Android-AltBeacon-Library) on Android.

Uses the AltBeacon Nuget/component from Xamarin to monitor and range Beacons in the foreground, and fire local notifications when
a region is entered or exited while the app is in the foreground or background.
